# Source Code

I wrote three 'modules' to help load and process the images.

1. [`image_processing`](./image_processing.py) deals with loading the images, resizing them and creating a usable numpy array
2. [`label_processing`](./label_processing.py) deals with cleaning up the label images
3. [`feature_processing`](./feature_processing) contains code for an sklearn preprocessing class for extracting the features for each image
